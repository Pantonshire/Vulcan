## Alpha 0.0.3
Released on 14th March 2018
* Added "swing" method for LivingEntity objects to allow them to swing their arms too, like Player objects
* Reimplemented "jump" method for LivingEntity objects using some nasty reflection
* Added an "explode" method for both Player and LivingEntity objects. Fairly self-explanatory. KABOOM!

## Alpha 0.0.2
Released on 13th March 2018  
* Added code comments. A double forward slash // will cause the rest of the line to be ignored when building Java files. Example: `tell player to jump //Causes the player to jump in the air!`
